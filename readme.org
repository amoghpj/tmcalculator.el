#+TITLE: Emacs helper to query NEB's Tm calculator API 
Prompts user for primers P1 and P2, the PCR reagents being used, and the conentration of primers used. Returns the annealing temperature for PCR. 

NOTE: This is NOT a part of NEB

* Usage
Single entry point: call =get-annealing-temperature=. You will be prompted for two primer sequences, the PCR reagents and concentration of primers in mM. That's it!

PS The annealing temperature Ta is added to the =kill-ring= so you can easily yank it into your buffer.
